# Biodiversity in National Parks – Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores biodiversity data from the National Parks Service to identify patterns in endangered species. The analysis focuses on conservation status, species categories, and park-level observations.

## Objectives
- Clean and analyze biodiversity data
- Identify trends in endangered species
- Visualize insights using Python
- Communicate findings clearly

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab

## Key Findings
- Mammals were found to be the most endangered category.
- Certain national parks had higher endangered species observations.
- Conservation efforts should prioritize high-risk categories and regions.

## Files Included
- Google Colab Notebook
- Dataset (species_info, observations)
